# Interlocks
In this project, electric substation equipment interlocks are implemented using C/C++. The code is tested on ATmega328P microcontroller embedded in Arduino Uno development board.
The simulation is done using Proteus software so you must have the software installed to run the simulation files included here. 
The code is self-documented and easy to understand. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me anytime.
